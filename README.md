# Android Calculator
A small proyect of a calculator in android that I made in school, I'd say that the biggest singularity of it is the conversion to the octal, binary, hexadecimal and decimal system, since not many cellphone calcuators have it. It also has the basic arithmetic operations. It's pretty functionable, but it might crash when you do operations in other systems than decimal, it's designed to only do operations on decimal system and then you can convert to the other systems or edit the number on that system.
"Calculadora.java" is the main activity, "Conversiones.java" is the class I used for conversions to dec/bin/oct/hex systems. "activity_calculadora.xml" contains all the buttons and EditText. The package name is estrada.leon.rafael.calculadora and the Manifest file doesn't contain anything special.
