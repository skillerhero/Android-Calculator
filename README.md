# AndroidCalculator
A small proyect of a calculator in android that I made in school, I'd say that the biggest singularity of it is the conversion to the octal, binary, hexadecimal and decimal system. It also has the basic arithmetic operations. It's pretty functionable, but it might crash when you do operations in other systems than decimal.
